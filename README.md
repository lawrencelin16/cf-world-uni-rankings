Repository for CF course open source data final project

This repository holds the course project named World University Rankings Analysis. The project comprises of multiple different files, including original data, prepared data, Python scripts, and a Tableau dashboard presentation.

Each year, various research organizations put together their own ranking of the universities from all around the world based on a multituide of factors and metrics. They also create rankings for many of these individual categories. 
The objective of this project is to conduct data analysis to discover strong trends about education in order to explore potential answers to key questions. Some of those questions which guided the initial data exploration include:

•	What factors correlate with universities having a high rank in broad impact?

•	What factors correlate with universities having a high rank in alumni employment?

•	What correlations does the student staff ratio have?

•	Where are the universities with the highest scores located?


Ultimately, the questions I chose to address with the analysis in this project is:
• How well do certain factors, such as a university's student staff ratio and quality of faculty rank, correlate with a university's quality of education rank? Do particular countries see stronger trends in these relationships?

The three original datasets used in this project were sourced from a [Kaggle public dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mylesoneill/world-university-rankings). 
The primary dataset used was the rankings by the Center for University Rankings. The rankings by the Times Higher Education World University Rankiing and the Academic Ranking of World Universities (also known as the Shanghai Ranking) were used as supplementary datasets.
The JSON containing geographical data for the countries around the world used in this project was sourced from a [different Kaggle public dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ktochylin/world-countries).

Python scripts were written in and ran using Jupyter notebooks to organize, manipulate, and analyze these datasets. 

Tableau was used to perform final data analysis and create data visualizations. These were purposed to build a storyboard in Tableau presenting the final analysis for this project. 
The Tableau storyboard can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/CFFinalProject-WorldUniversityRankingsCaseStudy/WorldUniversityRankingsCaseStudy?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
Note: The storyboard does not contain most initial preliminary exploratory analysis. It is focused on the analysis relevant to addressing the key question.
